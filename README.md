Title: Concrete with Cracks Image Classification Project

Project Description: This project is to predict classified image either the specified image is positively cracked or negatively uncracked. There are two projects in the folder since I want to try classification using LeNet5 as base model with additional feature extraction (transfer learning) and another one with MobileNetV2 as base model with additionla feature extraction (transfer learning). 

Details: The first project is to apply LeNet5 as base model with adding feature extraction layers. The second project is using MobileNetV2 as base model with adding feature extraction layers. Those application is the first strategy of transfer learning among three strategies: 1. Pre-trained model with feature extraction, 2: Pre-trained model with domain adaptation, 3: Pre-trained model with frozen layer. After building the model and adding another feature extraction, the model run and visualized. Finally, the model is used to predict specified image either it is cracked or not.
