# Concrete-with-Cracks-Image-Classification-Project
 This is a Concrete with Cracks Image Classification Project which is using Transfer Learning to make prediction on Concrete images either it is positively cracks or not.
The dataset contains the images of Concrete with uncracked and cracked (two classes {1- Positive (Cracked), 0 - Negative(Uncracked)}). There are two Jupyter Notebooks which are using only Le-Net5 to predict those images and another one is using transfer learning with MobileNetV2 as base model and another feature extraction layers added which implement a strategy of pre-trained model with feature extraction layers.

The explanation along with the source code is in every Jupyter Notebook file.
